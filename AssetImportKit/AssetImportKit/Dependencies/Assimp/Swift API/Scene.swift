/** AI_SCENE_FLAGS_INCOMPLETE
 * Specifies that the scene data structure that was imported is not complete.

 * of animation skeletons, material libraries or camera animation paths
 * using Assimp. Most applications won't support such data.

/** AI_SCENE_FLAGS_VALIDATED
 * This flag is set by the validation postprocess-step (aiPostProcess_ValidateDS)

 * any cross references in the data structure (e.g. vertex indices) are valid.

 * This flag is set by the validation postprocess-step (aiPostProcess_ValidateDS)

 * This can for example mean that a texture that does not exist is referenced
 * by a material or that the bone weights for a vertex don't sum to 1.0 ... .
 * In most cases you should still be able to use the import. This flag could
 * be useful for applications which don't capture Assimp's log output.

 * This flag is currently only set by the aiProcess_JoinIdenticalVertices step.

 * no vertex is ever referenced by more than one face.

/** AI_SCENE_FLAGS_TERRAIN
 * Denotes pure height-map terrain data. Pure terrains usually consist of quads,
 * sometimes triangles, in a regular grid. The x,y coordinates of all vertex
 * positions refer to the x,y coordinates on the terrain height map, the z-axis
 * stores the elevation at a specific point.
 *
 * TER (Terragen) and HMP (3D Game Studio) are height map formats.
 * @note Assimp is probably not the best choice for loading *huge* terrains -
 * fully triangulated data takes extremely much free store and should be avoided
 * as long as possible (typically you'll do the triangulation when you actually
 * need to render it).
